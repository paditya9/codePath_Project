## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

Some applications that intrigue me the most are:
1. Instagram:
  * Vanish mode
  * Custom background in chat
  * Double tap to like
  * Activity feed

2. Netflix:
  * Preview of the movie while hovering
  * Multiple user profiles
  * Content carousels
    
3. Google Maps:
  * Interactive maps
  * Street/3D view
  * Timeline bar
  * Satellite view 

## Notes

* ## Leanrning ##
  + Most interesting part was to understand the concept of how the colors are changing.

* ## Challenge ##
  + Something I was stuck was to figure out what "StoryBoard" was and how I can integrate the UI with the logic.
